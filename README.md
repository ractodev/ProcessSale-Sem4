# ProcessSale
## IV1350 Seminar 4 - a program to simulate a sale being processed.



### ProcessSale Overview:
ProcessSale is a simple point of sale (POS) system written in Java. It is a program with hardcoded commands designed to be run in an integrated development environment (IDE) until a graphical user interface (GUI) is added. The system is designed to be used by small businesses to manage their sales.

The system allows users to add products to a sale, calculate the total price of the sale, and print out a receipt. It also includes functionality for managing inventory and generating reports.

### Usage:

To use ProcessSale, you can open the ProcessSale.java file in an IDE that supports Java, such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA.

Since this program is still in its initial development stage and does not have a GUI yet, it may not be as user-friendly as other POS systems that have a graphical interface. However, it is still a functional program that can be used to manage sales for small businesses.
